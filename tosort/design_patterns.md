# Design patterns
Design Patterns tests understanding of the purpose of design patterns in
object-oriented programming and the ability to apply commonly used
patterns,including Model-View-Controller (MVC).

Inheritance and behavioral subtyping

## Creational patterns (5)
Create objects for you

- Factory method pattern
- Abstract factory pattern
- Singleton pattern
- Builder pattern
- Prototype pattern

## Structural patterns (7)
Class and object composition

- Adapter pattern
- Bridge pattern
- Composite pattern
- Decorator pattern
- Facade pattern
- Flyweight pattern
- Proxy pattern
 
## Behavioral patterns (11)
Communication between objects

- Chain-of-responsibility pattern
- Command pattern
- Interpreter pattern
- Iterator pattern
- Mediator pattern
- Memento pattern
- Observer pattern
- State pattern
- Strategy pattern
- Template method pattern
- Visitor pattern

## Creational

Factory
- define hierarchy of classes
- allow them to be instantiated dynamically
- creates objects without specifying the exact class to create

MVC (model view controller)
- 

Flyweight
- minimise memory usage by sharing as much as possible with similar objects
- objects must be immutable

Singleton
- restricts object creation for a class to only one instance
- access to a device/driver
- getInstance

Decorator
- extend class without using inheritance
- more flexible

## Behavioural

Active Object
- manage multiple concurrent processes
- asynchronous
- decouple the method from its invocation
- messages are placed on queues

Memento
- provides the ability to restore an object to its previous state (undo)
- CareTaker (array of mementos)
- Originator (creates mementos)

Visitor
- tax visitor: apply tax in different ways depending on the object passed in

Proxy
